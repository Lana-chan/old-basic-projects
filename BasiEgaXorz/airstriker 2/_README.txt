Here is the TFD files for AIRSTRIKER II.

*TITLE
*LEVEL
*BOSS

i tried my hand at making a weird ident thing for ELECTROKINESIS but its a bit crappy lol
.. actually i tried a couple but they all seemed to suck but this one sucked the least.. :P

Theres been some slight changes to the test roms i sent you but only in intrument sounds and i also managed to clean up unused syntax off the track so the TFD files have been reduced in KB (every little helps(the smaller the better .. or something)).

I have included test roms so you can hear what they sound like in stereo and so you know what its meant to sound like on the off chance that you run into errors with music playback in the game.
