the gmap: tells what map goes where in the game, takes up to 255 maps (you can re-use maps)
basically, you have maps 1, 2 and 3. 1 exits to the right to 2 that exits bottom to 3
should be something like this:

001,002
000,003

the zeroes are just for positioning, they contain no map (and making an exit to a zero may crash the game)
maps can exit to more than one other map, or to none at all, feel free to make complex mazes with this (think pitfall II)
