Old BASIC projects

====

These are some old BASIC projects around 2005-2009 I had lying around in my computer. Feel free to pick on my past self's brain.

Most of these files haven't been touched in over 7 years so I don't guarantee anything here to be working at all.

Summary, as of this commit:

* FreeBASIC
** psypong - A mediocre Pong clone with obstacles on later levels. First attempt making something with images and sound playback.
** spd - Faux-3D racing game, never left prototype stage.
** th2 - Treasure Hunt 2, sequel to a KNP game I made when I was 10. Never finished.
** th2ass - some copy of TH2, only known working build.
** WinDungeON - Windows version of an earlier project, DungeON. Faux-3D dungeon crawler.
** WoA - World of Artcraft, very rudimentary group-drawing program. It works.

* QuickBasic
** C3E - What's left of Compy 386 Emulator. Back in 2007 someone was making this in QBasic and I offered to help. The code was a terrible mess and I tried rewriting it, and that's all I have.
** DUNGEON - DungeON, vector-based dungeon crawler. Very rudimentary.
** MAITAI - MaiTAI Text Adventure Interpreter, my only finished QB project. No finished games were ever made for it.
** VISTAI - Updated version of MaiTAI with vector graphics support.
