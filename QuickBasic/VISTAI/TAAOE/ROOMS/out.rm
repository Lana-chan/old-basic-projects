Outside
&DESC
You are outside. You breathe some of this 'fresh air' everyone's been babbling
about for so long. It's actually filled with toxic elements from the automated
machines that humans seem to refer to as 'cars'. You think about starting a
'stop pollution' manifestation but ultimately decide to carry on with your own
life.
To the south there is your home.
