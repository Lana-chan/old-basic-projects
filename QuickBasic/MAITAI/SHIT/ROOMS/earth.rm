[MAITAI ROOM]
Earth
&DESC
You jump in the hole and land on Earth. Weird huh? But you actually land on an
hydrant to be more precise. Crotch-first to be even more specific. You'll never
have children again.
Besides that it's pretty up here. No more fire. You feel rejuvenated and less
burnt.
You see people in the distance to the north.
To the west there is a city.
